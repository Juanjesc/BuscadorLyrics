### See demo here: https://buscadorlyrics.netlify.app/
⚠️updated 12/12/22, the demo may not work properly, the api returns 200 status, but does not return any information, a couple of days ago the api had an update but still no documentation, it may be a bug because of this update. Waiting...
- This project has been created with **Vite**, more information here: https://vitejs.dev/guide/
- React.js has been used in this project, in order to practice this technology. 
- The api used for this project is: https://rapidapi.com/OsamaHu1277/api/lyrics-plus
## What have I learned from this project?
- Consuming API through AXIOS, previously I have always used fetch method.
- Using the RapidAPI platform.
- Create custom hooks, and use hooks like useContext in addition to useState.
- Use of environment variables
